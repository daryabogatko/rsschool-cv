## *About me*
I've just graduated from Law faculty at Belarusian State University. Despite learning law, my background includes a one year experience in sales. As a sale manager, I acquired a dynamic skill set that helps me daily. My strengths are strong communication skills, ability to remain calm under pressure and dealing with a large amount of information. I consider mysellf as a confident PC user in terms of Microsoft Office:) But now I'm willing to improve my skills and obtain useful knowledge. As for my language skills, I would define myself as Intermediate: I definitely can carry out basic communication. I has been studying English since school and developed my knowledge through traveling.
